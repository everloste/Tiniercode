# Tiniercode
Tiniercode is a tiny universal bitmap font.

The font height is at a mere 6 pixels, making it perfect for tiny resolutions while remaining fully legible.

This font supports all letters and common characters of the English alphabet. Due to its tiny size diacritics are unsupported.

This font was made for use in games, but feel free to use this font anywhere!

For programs like Aseprite, the smallest usable font size is 8, and so this font scales nicely to 16, 24, 32, etc.

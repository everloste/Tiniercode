*Tiniercode* is a tiny, modern, universal bitmap font.
The font height is a mere 6 pixels, making it great for tiny resolutions while remaining fully legible.

This font supports all letters and common characters of the English alphabet. Due to its tiny size diacritics are unsupported.

This font was made for use in game dev, but feel free to use it anywhere!
For programs like Aseprite, or anywhere where rendering is down to individual pixels, the smallest usable font size is 8, and so this font scales perfectly to 16, 24, 32, etc.

Tiniercode was inspired by [Tiny Unicode](https://www.dafont.com/tinyunicode.font), but is not based on it.
Although Tiny Unicode is a great font, and a longtime favourite of mine, I felt it would be good to make a newer, more compact alternative with Tiny Unicode's issues fixed, such as its line height being about twice or thrice what it needed to be.
Tiniercode hasn't got those issues, and is even tinier!
